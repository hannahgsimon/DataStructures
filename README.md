Program Files:  
Project_StackQueueLinkedList.java - This contains main.  
QueueList.java - Queue data structure, I modified so that it does not use a built-in queue data type, instead I implemented my own queue using a Linked List (I implemented a Linked List as well, did not use a built-in type) for internal storage.  
StackArray.java - Stack data structure, I modified it so that it does not use a built-in stack data type, instead I implemented my own stack using an array for internal storage.  
QueueArray.java - Queue data structure, I modified it so that it does not use a built-in queue data type, instead I implemented my own queue using an array for internal storage. The queue is circular.  
StackList.java - Stack data structure, I modified it so that it does not use a built-in stack data type, instead I implemented my own stack using a Linked List (which I implemented as well) for internal storage.
